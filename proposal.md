# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fortunate Future

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Fortune cookie gives different outcomes everytime you click button to get another fortune.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to write a python code where you have a fortune cookie and you can press a button and you get a new fortune everytime. The game will be based on probability and getting random answers. I wanted to add different things to it to make it more interesting. I'm not completely sure, but I'll figure it out as I keep progressing in the project. I want it to work in a way where the game can be fun to keep getting different outcomes and fortunes.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have the base of the game at least which could be fun on it's own.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have the base, and some other features ready. Also is a bit fun at the least.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to make a game that is fun no matter what. Something that looks fun and is fun. Also it will pass perfectly.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

While looking around for how to make sure my game will work. Some things seem to be a bit out of reach such as some things that haven't been taught in Python class. But I could definately learn some new commands and enhance my game to make sure it can be functional and fun. Some things I probably have to research is how to make working base codes or maybe even use other base codes and add more fun features to them. Overall, in the next steps I need to learn more things and go out of my comfort zone to make sure the game can be as fun as possible.
