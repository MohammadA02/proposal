# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snake.Iro (Iro means Color in Japanese)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Snake eats apple but changes colors with new colored apples.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'm thinking about making my game the Snake and apple game but the apple can change colors, and the color of the snake can change whenever the apple changes colors. I'm sure throughout the program there will be many if statements which will indicate when to change the color of the snake and the apple. Even with what should happen when a different colored apple is consumed by the snake. Some colors could possibly make the snake slower or faster too. Also, the game will be made in Python.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have the base of the game at least which could be fun on it's own.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have the base, and some other features ready. Also is a bit fun at the least.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to make a game that is fun no matter what. Something that looks fun and is fun. Also it will pass perfectly.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

While looking around for how to make sure my game will work. Some things seem to be a bit out of reach such as some things that haven't been taught in Python class. But I could definately learn some new commands and enhance my game to make sure it can be functional and fun. Some things I probably have to research is how to make working base codes or maybe even use other base codes and add more fun features to them. Overall, in the next steps I need to learn more things and go out of my comfort zone to make sure the game can be as fun as possible.
